    The analysis covered the historical price trends of TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, and NSE50 from 2008 to 2025, focusing on performance during key periods, including the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The following steps were taken:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Statistical Performance:</strong> Key metrics such as mean returns, standard deviation, minimum and maximum returns, and quartile distributions were calculated to evaluate the performance of the stocks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Trend Identification:</strong> Moving averages (50-day and 200-day) were plotted to identify significant patterns, such as the "golden cross" and "death cross," which indicate potential upward or downward trends in stock performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Long-term Performance and SIP Potential:</strong> Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) scenarios were analyzed by simulating the purchase of one share of each stock at regular intervals. Metrics such as total investment, average cost per share, unrealized profits, and ROI were assessed to determine the suitability of each stock for long-term investment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Comparison of Annual Returns:</strong> Annualized returns were calculated to provide consistent measures of performance over time, highlighting the relative performance of each stock and their correlation with the broader market (NSE50).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Volatility and Risk Assessment:</strong> Beta analysis was conducted to measure each stock's volatility relative to the market. TCS demonstrated low beta, signifying stability, while Tata Motors and Tata Steel exhibited higher beta values, indicating greater volatility and risk.

    <li>
      <strong>Sectoral Trends:</strong> The study identified trends influenced by external factors such as global economic conditions, industry-specific challenges, and government policies that impacted stock performance.
