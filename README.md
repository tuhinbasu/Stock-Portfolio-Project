In this analysis, we conducted a comprehensive study of the performance of Tata's flagship stocks (TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Steel) and NSE50 to evaluate their historical performance, trends, and potential for long-term investment. A detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to derive meaningful insights and identify key patterns. Below is a description of the approach we followed:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We analyzed the historical price trends of TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, and NSE50 from 2008 to 2025 to observe their performance across various periods, including significant economic events like the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
Key metrics such as mean returns, standard deviation, minimum and maximum returns, and quartile distributions were computed to understand the statistical performance of the stocks.
Moving averages (50-day and 200-day) were plotted to identify trends like the "golden cross" and "death cross," which signal potential upward or downward trends in stock performance.
Long-term Performance and SIP Potential:

Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) scenarios were analyzed by assuming the purchase of one share of each stock at regular intervals. This helped evaluate the total investment, average cost per share, unrealized profits, and ROI over the entire period.
We assessed the suitability of each stock for long-term SIP investments based on their stability, returns, and volatility.
Comparison of Annual Returns:

Annualized returns were calculated for all stocks to provide a consistent measure of investment performance over time.
A detailed comparison of the annual returns highlighted the relative performance of each stock and its correlation with the broader market (NSE50).
Trend and Pattern Analysis:

Beta analysis was performed to assess each stock's volatility relative to the market. TCS exhibited a low beta, indicating stability, while Tata Motors and Tata Steel had higher beta values, suggesting greater volatility and risk.
Sectoral trends were identified, highlighting how external factors like global economic conditions, industry-specific challenges, and government policies impacted the stocks’ performance.
Findings:
Through this study, we uncovered valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of Tata’s key stocks and their alignment with the broader market trends. Each stock presented a unique investment profile: TCS emerged as a stable growth stock, Tata Motors and Tata Steel as high-risk, high-reward opportunities, and NSE50 as a benchmark for steady, market-aligned growth. These insights provide a robust foundation for informed investment decisions.
